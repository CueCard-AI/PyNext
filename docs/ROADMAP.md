# PyNext Roadmap

This document tracks future enhancements and features for PyNext. Ideas captured here are not currently in development but represent the product vision.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Figma Integration

Connecting Figma to the component registry would streamline designer-developer collaboration:

- [ ] **Design tokens sync** — Extract colors, typography, spacing from Figma → auto-generate Tailwind config and CSS variables
- [ ] **Component scaffolding** — Generate PyNext component skeletons from Figma component designs
- [ ] **Figma plugin** — Allow designers to mark components as "export to PyNext" with defined props/variants
- [ ] **Bi-directional linking** — Track implementation status, detect when designs drift from code

---

### Advanced Components (Phase 2+)

More complex interactive components:

- [ ] **Calendar / DatePicker** — Date selection with range support
- [ ] **Combobox / Autocomplete** — Searchable select with filtering
- [ ] **Command palette** — cmdk-style command menu (⌘K)
- [ ] **Data Table** — Sortable, filterable, paginated tables
- [ ] **Charts** — Integration with Chart.js or similar
- [ ] **File upload** — Drag-and-drop with preview
- [ ] **Rich text editor** — WYSIWYG content editing
- [ ] **Toast / Sonner** — Non-blocking notifications
- [ ] **Tooltip** — Contextual hover information
- [ ] **Popover** — Floating content panels
- [ ] **Sheet / Drawer** — Slide-out panels
- [ ] **Skeleton** — Loading placeholder animations

---

### Component System Enhancements

Improving the component development and usage experience:

- [ ] **Visual component playground** — Storybook-like environment for testing components in isolation
- [ ] **Component versioning** — Track versions in registries, handle breaking changes
- [ ] **Automatic accessibility auditing** — Built-in a11y checks for components
- [ ] **Dark mode / theming system** — More robust theme switching and customization
- [ ] **Animation presets library** — Common animations (fade, slide, scale) ready to use
- [ ] **Responsive variant helpers** — Easier responsive props (e.g., `size={"sm": "sm", "md": "lg"}`)

---

### Developer Experience

Making PyNext easier and more enjoyable to use:

- [ ] **VS Code extension** — Component autocomplete, prop suggestions, documentation hover
- [ ] **Component generator CLI** — `pynext generate component MyButton`
- [ ] **Hot module replacement** — Update components without full page reload
- [ ] **Visual diff** — Show changes when registry components update
- [ ] **Error boundaries** — Graceful error handling in components
- [ ] **DevTools integration** — Browser extension for inspecting PyNext state

---

### Ecosystem

Building the PyNext community and ecosystem:

- [ ] **Official component marketplace** — Directory of community components
- [ ] **Community contribution process** — Guidelines for submitting components
- [ ] **Component quality badges** — Verified, accessible, tested indicators
- [ ] **Integration with Python frameworks** — First-class support for FastAPI, Django, Flask
- [ ] **Templates and starters** — Pre-built application templates

---

### Performance

Optimizing for production:

- [ ] **Component-level code splitting** — Only load component JS when needed
- [ ] **Server-side streaming** — Progressive rendering for faster TTFB
- [ ] **Partial hydration improvements** — More granular island hydration
- [ ] **Static extraction** — Extract static components to pure HTML
- [ ] **Bundle analysis** — Tools to identify and reduce bundle size

---

### Testing

Making components easier to test:

- [ ] **Testing utilities** — Helpers for testing PyNext components
- [ ] **Visual regression testing** — Automated screenshot comparison
- [ ] **Accessibility testing integration** — Axe, Pa11y integration
- [ ] **Component snapshot testing** — Track HTML output changes

---
