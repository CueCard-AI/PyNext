# PyNext Roadmap

This document tracks future enhancements and features for PyNext. Ideas captured here are not currently in development but represent the product vision.

## Future Enhancements

### Figma Integration

Connecting Figma to the component registry would streamline designer-developer collaboration:

- [ ] **Design tokens sync** — Extract colors, typography, spacing from Figma → auto-generate Tailwind config and CSS variables
- [ ] **Component scaffolding** — Generate PyNext component skeletons from Figma component designs
- [ ] **Figma plugin** — Allow designers to mark components as "export to PyNext" with defined props/variants
- [ ] **Bi-directional linking** — Track implementation status, detect when designs drift from code

---

### Advanced Components (Phase 2+) — COMPLETED ✓

All 12 advanced components have been implemented:

- [x] **Skeleton** — Loading placeholder animations
- [x] **Tooltip** — Contextual hover information
- [x] **Popover** — Floating content panels
- [x] **Toast / Sonner** — Non-blocking notifications
- [x] **Sheet / Drawer** — Slide-out panels
- [x] **Combobox / Autocomplete** — Searchable select with filtering
- [x] **Command palette** — cmdk-style command menu (⌘K)
- [x] **Calendar / DatePicker** — Date selection with range support

- [ ] **Visual diff** — Show changes when registry components update
- [ ] **Error boundaries** — Graceful error handling in components
- [ ] **DevTools integration** — Browser extension for inspecting PyNext state

---

### Ecosystem

Building the PyNext community and ecosystem:

- [ ] **Official component marketplace** — Directory of community components
- [ ] **Community contribution process** — Guidelines for submitting components
- [ ] **Component quality badges** — Verified, accessible, tested indicators
- [ ] **Integration with Python frameworks** — First-class support for FastAPI, Django, Flask
- [ ] **Templates and starters** — Pre-built application templates

---

### Real-Time & Browser APIs

Native Python APIs for browser-specific features (currently require `script()` escape hatch):

- [ ] **`use_event_source()`** — Server-Sent Events (SSE) with automatic reconnection

- [ ] **`use_window_size()`** — Viewport dimensions tracking
- [ ] **`use_scroll_position()`** — Scroll position tracking
- [ ] **`use_intersection()`** — Intersection Observer for lazy loading

---

### Performance

Optimizing for production:

- [ ] **Component-level code splitting** — Only load component JS when needed
- [ ] **Server-side streaming** — Progressive rendering for faster TTFB
- [ ] **Partial hydration improvements** — More granular island hydration
- [ ] **Static extraction** — Extract static components to pure HTML
- [ ] **Bundle analysis** — Tools to identify and reduce bundle size

---

### Testing

Making components easier to test:
